# ML-Experiments

Welcome to my repository of machine learning experiments! Here, you'll find a collection of projects exploring various techniques like neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. These projects showcase my ability to tackle different machine learning problems across various domains.

Project Structure:

**notebooks:** This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for each project. Notebooks are named descriptively to indicate their purpose.

**data:** This folder stores datasets used in the project notebooks. Datasets may be further organized into subfolders based on project or competition.
Project Highlights:

**Kaggle Competitions:** This repository includes projects specifically designed for Kaggle competitions. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets and solve practical machine learning problems (look for notebooks starting with **kaggle-**).

**Diverse Techniques:** My experiments explore a range of machine learning techniques, including deep learning, traditional algorithms, and ensemble methods. This showcases my versatility in applying different approaches to solve problems.

**Transfer Learning:** Some projects may utilize transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models and achieve better performance. 

**Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** My notebooks emphasize the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering for improving model performance.

## Learning and Improvement:

This repository is a continuous learning journey.  I'm constantly striving to improve my skills and explore new techniques.  Feel free to browse through the notebooks and see the thought processes behind each project.
